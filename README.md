# ManiaScriptSharp

ManiaScriptSharp is a way to type ManiaScript with C# features. C# code is compiled into both .NET library and a set of ManiaScript files.

### 4 reasons why ManiaScriptSharp exists

1. Easier syntax
2. Accurate auto-complete
3. Flexible accessibility
4. Unit-testability

This project **does not guarantee anything**. It was written while practicing source generators as a beginner, and the code is **admittedly low-effort, hacky, and not maintainable.** It can take hundreds of hours to rewrite it into something cleaner, but this **should be preferred** if this project hooks wider interest. Let me know if you're interested in doing something like this, I can offer a variety of help or even collaborate.

## Techniques

### Contexts

`IContext` generates `main()` and `while(x)`. Given C# methods are `Main()` and `Loop()`.

### Inheritance (`#RequireContext` and `#Extends`)

`#RequireContext` and `#Extends` are generated based on C# class inheritance. If the class is "official" (part of `ManiaScriptSharp` namespace), `#RequireContext` is used, otherwise it's `#Extends`.

`#Extends` is generated by taking the class namespace as a directory path, and the class name as a file name without the extension.

### Library inclusions

Standard library inclusions are hardcoded.

Custom library inclusions are defined with the `IncludeAttribute`.

### Constants

C#:
```csharp
const int Constant = 5;
```
ManiaScript:
```
#Const Constant 5
```

### Settings

### Globals

### Bindings

### Functions

### Event handling (optional feature)

### Labels (`***` and `+++`)

The closest C# feature to labels is virtual methods.

### Netwrites

### Netreads

### Locals

### Pattern matching

ManiaScriptSharp provides a powerful set of snippet generators for the pattern matching with the C#'s `is` keyword.

### Switch statement

#### Manialink XML

## `.csproj` example

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="ManiaScriptSharp" />
    <Using Static="true" Include="ManiaScriptSharp.ManiaScript" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="ManiaScriptSharp.Generator\ManiaScriptSharp.Generator.csproj" OutputItemType="Analyzer" ReferenceOutputAssembly="false" />
    <ProjectReference Include="ManiaScriptSharp.ManiaPlanet\ManiaScriptSharp.ManiaPlanet.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
	
  <ItemGroup>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="buildsettings.yml" /> <!-- Optional build settings tweaking -->
    <AdditionalFiles Include="manialink_v3_ns.xsd" /> <!-- Optional Manialink XML validation -->
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## `buildsettings.yml` example

```yaml
OutputDir: C:/MyManiaPlanetServer/UserData # Build root (default is the relative folder 'out')
Packed: false # If the output will be packed into a folder with the name of the project
```
