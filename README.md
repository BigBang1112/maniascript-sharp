# ManiaScriptSharp

ManiaScriptSharp is a way to type ManiaScript with C# features. C# code is compiled into both .NET library and a set of ManiaScript files.

### 4 reasons why ManiaScriptSharp exists

1. Easier syntax
2. Accurate auto-complete
3. Flexible accessibility
4. Unit-testability

This project **does not guarantee anything**. It was written while practicing source generators as a beginner, and the code is **admittedly low-effort, hacky, and not maintainable.** It can take hundreds of hours to rewrite it into something cleaner, but this **should be preferred** if this project hooks wider interest. Let me know if you're interested in doing something like this, I can offer a variety of help or even collaborate.

## Usage

1. Create a C# library project (any other project type is not supported)
2. Update the project settings (`.csproj`) with:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ManiaScriptSharp" Version="0.2.0" /> <!-- attributes, markers, ... -->
    <PackageReference Include="ManiaScriptSharp.Generator" Version="0.2.0" /> <!-- generator of ManiaScript -->
    <PackageReference Include="ManiaScriptSharp.ManiaPlanet" Version="0.2.0" /> <!-- use ManiaPlanet (TM2/SM) scripting API -->
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="ManiaScriptSharp" /> <!-- to implicitly import all classes -->
    <Using Static="true" Include="ManiaScriptSharp.ManiaScript" /> <!-- to easily use log(), assert(), etc. -->
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- <AdditionalFiles Include="buildsettings.yml" /> --> <!-- optional settings for building (will change in the future) -->
    <!-- <AdditionalFiles Include="manialink_v3_ns.xsd" /> --> <!-- optional manialink XML validator: https://github.com/reaby/manialink-xsd/blob/main/manialink_v3_ns.xsd -->
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```
3. Pick one of the context classes like you would in ManiaScript (`CMapEditorPlugin`, `CTmMode`, `CTmMlScriptIngame`, ...)
4. Create directories based on where these scripts should lay (`CTmMode` would lay in `Scripts/Modes/TrackMania` for example)
5. Create a C# class there and start with this skeleton:
```csharp
namespace MyProject;

public class MyGamemode : CTmMode, IContext
{
    public void Main()
    {
        
    }

    public void Loop()
    {
        
    }
}
```
6. After running Build, ManiaScript will generate into the `out` folder next to the source code, following the directory path. If it does not happen or you get weird warnings, restart your IDE or try different build options.
7. To redirect the output, create `buildsettings.yml` in the root project folder, and write this content:
```yaml
OutputDir: C:/MyManiaPlanetServer/UserData # Build root (default is the relative folder 'out')
Packed: false # If the output will be packed into a folder with the name of the project
```

## Techniques

### Contexts

`IContext` generates `main()` and `while(x)`. Given C# methods are `Main()` and `Loop()`.

### Inheritance (`#RequireContext` and `#Extends`)

`#RequireContext` and `#Extends` are generated based on C# class inheritance. If the class is "official" (part of `ManiaScriptSharp` namespace), `#RequireContext` is used, otherwise it's `#Extends`.

`#Extends` is generated by taking the class namespace as a directory path, and the class name as a file name without the extension.

### Library inclusions

Standard library inclusions are hardcoded (may change in the future).

Custom library inclusions are defined with the `IncludeAttribute`.

### Types

The mappings are as following:

### Constants

C#:
```csharp
const int Constant = 5;
```
ManiaScript:
```
#Const Constant 5
```

### Settings

Settings are decorated using the `SettingAttribute`. They can be either constants or read-only fields, as you should not change them throughout the script.

Read-only fields are allowed to support types that are not allowed to be a C# constant, like an array for example.

Translation of setting names is attempted automatically by default. You can turn this off by setting `Translated = false` on the `SettingAttribute`.

C#:
```csharp
[Setting]
const string AdminLogin = "bigbang1112";

[Setting(As = "Chat time")]
const int ChatTime = 50;
```
ManiaScript:
```
#Setting AdminLogin "bigbang1112"
#Setting ChatTime 50 as _("Chat time")
```

### Change detection

There's a special built in feature on settings that you can use to detect when a setting has changed. This was made for a possiblity to avoid repeating patterns in the C# code, but it also generates netwrites that you can use to read in client manialinks. It is a bit clunky to implement though so just be aware of it.

You can turn this on by adding `SettingsChangeDetectorsAttribute` on your class that has the settings you wanna work with (may be changed to interface in the future).

This will generate two new labels `Settings` and `UpdateSettings` (currently not caring if you can call them or not), so you have to add these methods manually:

```cs
public virtual void Settings() { }
public virtual void UpdateSettings() { }
```

`Settings` will initialize the detectors, and `UpdateSettings` should be called in a loop, preferably in every loop.

`SettingAttribute` has 2 additional settings:
- `ReloadOnChange` - when a change is detected, set `Reload` to true. This requires you to have a field boolean `Reload` in the C# code for it to translate correctly.
- `CallOnChange` - name of the method to call when the change is detected. Best practice is to use `nameof()`



### Globals

### Bindings

### Functions

### Event handling (optional feature)

### Labels (`***` and `+++`)

The closest C# feature to labels is virtual methods.

### Netwrites

### Netreads

### Locals

### Pattern matching

ManiaScriptSharp provides a powerful set of snippet generators for the pattern matching with the C#'s `is` keyword.

### Switch statement

#### Manialink XML

### Accessors

It is not required to use `public` accessors for the generator to recognize the classes. Use ones you need to better show what you mean to expose.
